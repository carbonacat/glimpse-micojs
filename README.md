## Introduction

You're a person who just wake up, except everything is different around you!
And ... you keep falling asleep again around 8:00... only to wake up at exactly 7:24 again!
Something is clearly wrong. Find your way out of this bad dream!

This is my entry for the MicoJS Jam, which uses the MicoJS brought by FManga (https://github.com/felipemanga).
It's rather short and unpolished, but I do hope it's fun enough for you! 


## Gameplay & Controls

- Pad - Move around.
- A - Open doors, Activate levers.
- B - Pick up or put down items.
- You can only carry one item!
- After the time reach 8:00, the world is reset to 7:24 again.
- Your watch indicates the time.
- You might want to focus your efforts in each run to find the way out!
- You can use B to skip the initial countdown to 7:24.

Good luck!

## Notes

- I only own the Pokitto and Gamebuino Meta, binaries work on these (at least on my devices). I'm not sure about the otherone, hopefully they do!
- If it works, it should be playable on each devices despite the resolution changes. I wish there were a 2x zoom feature for the higher resolution devices tho ...
- I had to cut a lot of things because everything is costly in this implementation of javascript. Which is, tbh, already a feat for these memory/cpu limited devices!!
- I shall release the source once I find a proper license!
- Hu, about the 0.0.1 version, I had an issue rebuilding the binaries, but they're expected to be 1.0.0! Sorry for that
